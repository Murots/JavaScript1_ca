# JavaScript1 - Course Assignment

EuroPedia by Aleksander Storum

## Changes/problems

I find jsreally hard to understand, but i guess its all about practice, like everything else. Slowly I understand more and more. I still need to stydy the modules to get anywhere, and Im not very confident when presented with a blank js-file. Anyway, Im farly happy with my product and end-result. I have kept the design really simple, and I have not bothered or had time to deal with media queries. With more js-knowledge, I would have liked to make som additions to the site, like making links from the border values on the detail pages. I tried to do this, but my js is simply not that advanced yet. Maybe its easier than i think, because I often find myself either overcomplicating or undercomplicating stuff.
